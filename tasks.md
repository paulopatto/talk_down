We need a web forum system in Ruby on Rails:

- [ ] The discussion is in threads, which a comment in a thread is another thread, in tree style. A thread could have many comments.
- [x] Each thread shoud have the text body and email who created.
- [ ] It should have pagination to easy navigation through root threads.
- [ ] It should send a daily summary email to users who participated in root threads updated on the day.
- [ ] It should have a blacklist, to replace ugly words to *****.
- [ ] It should have tests and performance code.
- [ ] It should be persisted in a database.
- [ ] We expect a simple solution, no need to worry about user access control or awesome frontend experience, but make something usable!
- [ ] Please don't use forum or blacklist gems! :-)
- [ ] If possible, deploy your app at Heroku.
